		<h2>Welcome</h2>
		<p>This tool is created to make planning and sharing battle tactics quick and easy. Just press the blue button, share the link and get started. <% if (game == 'wot') { %> Are you an FC trying to plan a clan war or stronghold battle in world of tanks? Or are you part of team that wants to perform better in team battles or ESL? Or do you just want to discuss some details about a map with a friend? Then this tool is for you. If you are used to maptactic, give this a try. Planning has never been easier.<% } %>

		<h2>Your input matters</h2>
		<p>Take 5 mins to take this very short <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1HvU6HrJVuLsRqI1cx5YLzZd011rUt_EirMU3BGgySrA/viewform">survey</a>, and let met know what you want in wottactic. I'll leave it up for at least two weeks and then release the results.</p>
		
		<p>After you have filled it in, take a look at the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1HvU6HrJVuLsRqI1cx5YLzZd011rUt_EirMU3BGgySrA/viewanalytics?usp=form_confirm">summary</a> of the results

		<h2>New video tutorial</h2>
		<p>I've created a <a href="https://youtu.be/K-yl_WNjvwk">tutorial</a> explaining all the tools and features of <%=url.split('/')[0]%>. And here's another <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLWv7yXYQ-c">tutorial</a> by Stewiejp.</div>

	</div>
	
	<div class="row">
	<div class="col-md-4">
		<h2>New domains</h2>
		<p>I've registered <a href="http://wottactic.eu">http://wottactic.eu</a> and <a href="http://wottactic.com">http://wottactic.com</a>, you can start using those right now. I tried to register wottactic.asia as well but couldn't because I needed a contact in the asia region, if you can help me with that, contact me. 
		
		<p>I'm not redirecting people quite yet, but may in the future. The site will remain available through the tk domains though.
		
		<p>The idea is to create a server in the NA and Asia region. People living in EU should then preferably use the .eu domain, people in NA, the .com domain and people in Asia the .asia domain. All your stored tactics will be available in all regions. In practice it will make the pages load a little bit faster, but mostly it will make the ping and the track cursor tools a lot more in sync for people outside the eu, where I'm currently hosting from.
		
		<p>I pretty much did all the legwork already when I created multiple servers to handle the extra load.
		
		<p>Extra servers do cost extra money though. So I added this as goals to my <a href="https://www.patreon.com/kalith">patreon</a> page. If you want this to happen faster, consider donating.

		<h2>Future plans</h2>
		<p>Now that the wot campaign is over, things should get a little quieter, so I'm going to use this opportunity to improve and expand a bit.
		
		<p>People seem to find this tool very useful for wot, so I'm going to see if people from a few other games would be interested in it. I'll be starting with league of legend, cause it's easy (not too many maps). If you want a version of wottactic for your favourite game, let me know.
		
		<p>Next, not a lot of people have filled in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1HvU6HrJVuLsRqI1cx5YLzZd011rUt_EirMU3BGgySrA/viewform">survey</a>, but there are some good suggestions in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1HvU6HrJVuLsRqI1cx5YLzZd011rUt_EirMU3BGgySrA/viewanalytics?usp=form_confirm">results</a>. 
		
		<p>I got that people want:
			<ol>
			<li>More store/share options 
			<li>More tools 
			<li>Improved ui
			<li>Better maps
			</ol>
		<p>Specifically I got people asking for:
			<ol>
			<li>A zoom option
			<li>A colorblind option 
			<li>Spawns on the aw and wows maps 
			<li>More security
			</ol>
			
		<p>I'm having a hard time finding good quality WOWS maps. If you have any idea pls get in touch. 
		
		<p>Also I'm not to sure what a color blind mode means exactly. If you are color blind, could you tell what works and what doesn't and how best to fix it.

		<h2>Latest changes</h2>
		<p>
		Nothing major, but mostly small usabilty impovements: <ul>
			<li>Added a hilight of the user making changes or pinging
			<li>Added zoom in/out with the scrollwheel and panning while holding the right or middle mouse button, give it a try
			<li>Removed the redirect when pushing new room
			<li>Icon packs are now fetched from spritesheets instead of download individual files. <a href="http://karellodewijk.github.io/lol_champions.jpg">"eg</a>
			<li>Added a League of Legends version, take a <a href="http://gametactic.org/lol">look</a>
		</ul> 
		On the bug hunting front:
		<ul>
			<li>Remove tracked cursor when someone loses privileges
			<li>Creating stuff outside the viewable area would sometimes stretch new things you added.
			<li>Select tool would often not properly select things after the tactic window was resized
			<li>I fixed it to work with rectangular maps
			<li>Note tool no longer has a save button, it will just save whenever the text field loses focus
		</ul>
		If you find anything else, however small, that is broken, pls let me know.
