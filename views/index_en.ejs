			<h2>Video replay room</h2>
			<p>As you may have noticed there is a new 'video replay room' button next to the new room button. It's something new I'm experimenting with.
			
			<p>I was watching a League of Legends match and afterwards they were showing some replays to hilight certain things. I figured being to do that live and online is not something that exists yet and may be useful. 

			<p>Now, I'm not saying it's perfect. The drawing part is not a problem, but starting and keeping videos in sync especially through the youtube api is tricky. And I don't think it's something I can improve upon greatly. Basically the youtube API is just lacking the nescessary tools (no fine grained playback rate control, course seek function and play/pause delays).
			
			<p>A direct link to a supported video file (anything supported by your browser) will work better. But is there a even free video service that allows you to access video files directly and embed them remotely ?
			
			<p>Anyway give it a try and give me some feedback. Do you like the idea, do you have a use for it ? Does it work for you or your team ? What problems are you experiencing ? Does youtube video synchronization well enough or do you consider it unusable as it is ?

			<h2>Future plans</h2>
			<ul>
				<li style="text-decoration: line-through;">Add options to scale/modify/rotate existing items
				<li>Write text directly on the map
				<li>Share folders in addition to just tactics
			</ul>
			If you have any suggestions, you can put them on the forums, contact me by e-mail or put them in the survey.

			<h2>Latest changes</h2>
			<p>
			<ul>
				<li>Added wows plane icons
				<li>Limited max font size to 48, but made sure it can always be rendered properly regardless of length.
				<li>Added "You also have tactics for: ..." to the stored tactics page
				<li>Added video replay room
				<li>Changed arrow draw code
			</ul> 
			On the bug hunting front:
			<ul>
				<li>Arrows were drawn way too small when zoomed in
				<li>Notes wouldn't open.
				<li>Fixed bug where multiple people simultaneously pinging would make the colors switch.
				<li>Fixed bug where icons would dissapear after undoing a move.
				<li>Fixed bug on IE where sometimes pings would be hidden after switching maps.
			</ul>
			If you find anything else, however small, that is broken, pls let me know.
