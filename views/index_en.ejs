		<h2>New video tutorial</h2>
		<p>I've created a <a href="https://youtu.be/K-yl_WNjvwk">tutorial video</a> explaining all the tools and features of <%=url.split('/')[0]%>. It should explain to you how to use the different tools, teach you about different shortcuts you may not know about and explain some of the more advanced features. Let me know what you think about it in youtube comments.

	<div class="col-md-4">
		<h2>Recent updates</h2>
		<p>The maps have been updated, based on the hd mini-maps from locastan and ShuraBB, yes the ones from the hd mini-map mod. I've also done round and updated the AW and WOWS maps, they're not quite as nice, but at least they should be all there, better check if wot 9.14 has any map changes. Other than that, I've added the option under stored tactic to add the slides of a tactic to an already open room.

		<h2>Suggestions</h2>
		<p>
		I'd like to hear from you, what do you think can still be improved? Do you think any other games would benefit from a map tool like this? Let me know on one of the forum topics linked in the about page or by mail.
