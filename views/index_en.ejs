		<h2>Recent updates</h2>
		<p>I just rolled out a bit of an update. The big new feature is that you can now create a tactic with different slides. It should make creating videos like this a little easier: <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkCWK2VDLxw'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkCWK2VDLxw</a>. Other than that, free draw should feel a bit smoother. Track cursor has a few cursor options, probably will add a few different ping options later. Text should be a little more legible, although it's not quite there yet. Improved handling of disconnects and timeouts. And quite a bit of smaller fixes. Also links to tactics will now remain available for up to a year instead of a month after they've been last visited. If you have any issues with new or existing tactics, pls let me know.

		<h2>Future plans</h2>
		<p>
		I want to look into improving maps. Something that has always bothered me is that cap points are not to scale. If you can or want to help with that, let me know. Other than that, I'd like to hear from you, what do you think can still be improved? Do you think any other games would benefit from a map tool like this? Let me know on one of the forum topics linked in the about page or by mail.
