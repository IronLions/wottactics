		<h2>New video tutorial</h2>
		<p>I've created a <a href="https://youtu.be/K-yl_WNjvwk">tutorial video</a> explaining all the tools and features of <%=url.split('/')[0]%>. It should explain to you how to use the different tools, teach you about different shortcuts you may not know about and explain some of the more advanced features. Let me know what you think about it in youtube comments.

		<h2>Recent updates</h2>
		<p>First of all yesterday the ping marker wasn't working for a few hours, really sorry about that. Other than breaking stuff, I've also added some things. I updated the drawing code a bit. You can now select any color (on every browser that supports them). All shapes/curves can now be dotted. Much nicer arrows. And the draw code as a whole has been overhauled and should look a bit nice and feel a bit smoother.

		<h2>Future plans</h2>
		<p>
		I want to look into improving maps. Something that has always bothered me is that cap points are not to scale. If you can or want to help with that, let me know. Other than that, I'd like to hear from you, what do you think can still be improved? Do you think any other games would benefit from a map tool like this? Let me know on one of the forum topics linked in the about page or by mail.
