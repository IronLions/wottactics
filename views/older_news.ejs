			<h2>New domains</h2>
			<p>I've registered <a href="http://wottactic.eu">http://wottactic.eu</a> and <a href="http://wottactic.com">http://wottactic.com</a>, you can start using those right now. I tried to register wottactic.asia as well but couldn't because I needed a contact in the asia region, if you can help me with that, contact me. 
			
			<p>I'm not redirecting people quite yet, but may in the future. The site will remain available through the tk domains though.
			
			<p>The idea is to create a server in the NA and Asia region. People living in EU should then preferably use the .eu domain, people in NA, the .com domain and people in Asia the .asia domain. All your stored tactics will be available in all regions. In practice it will make the pages load a little bit faster, but mostly it will make the ping and the track cursor tools a lot more in sync for people outside the eu, where I'm currently hosting from.
			
			<p>I pretty much did all the legwork already when I created multiple servers to handle the extra load.
			
			<p>Extra servers do cost extra money though. So I added this as goals to my <a href="https://www.patreon.com/kalith">patreon</a> page. If you want this to happen faster, consider donating.

			<h2><%=url.split('/')[0]%> in numbers</h2>
			<p>I want to tank everybody for your trust, <%=url.split('/')[0]%> has a grown a lot lately, more than I ever expected. It's only at the start of this month I started monitoring traffic and I was amazed. The last month 46,936 unique users have visited the site 193,829 times, opening 363,073 pages. Around 8,000 visits and 6,000 users a day. 
			
			<p>
			The overwelming majority use it for wot (98%). 78% of users come from Europe excluding Russia, 12% from the Americas and 6% from Asia. Although wot is huge in Russia, it accounts for only 2% of visitors. 
			Most traffic is between 19u30-22u CET with <a href="http://karellodewijk.github.io/active_users.png">peaks</a> of 1,000 symultanious users just before CW start. With a smaller peak around 01u-05u CET during NA cw time.

			<p>
			During peak times, Cpu usage on the amazon T2 micro VM i host it on, hovers around 20%, so still plenty of room to expand even without spending extra.
			
			<p>
			For those interested in the sources and more details, here is a <a href="http://karellodewijk.github.io/wottactic_stats.pdf">google analytics reports</a> for March and an <a href="http://karellodewijk.github.io/hourly.pdf">hourly breakdown</a>.

			<h2>Suggestions</h2>
			<p>
			I'd like to hear from you, what do you think can still be improved? Do you think any other games would benefit from a map tool like this? Let me know on one of the forum topics linked in the about page or by mail.
